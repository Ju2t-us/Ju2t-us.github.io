            <p>Dave was running for mayor in a small town in Washington.</p>
            <p>He realized that he needed something to set him apart from his opponents, but he just couldn't figure out what that should be.</p>
            <p>Then one day, he came up with <i>the</i> question- he discovered his motto, the cornerstone of his campaign: </p>
            <b>
                <p>
                    Does the model year of electric vehicles affect the amount of data breaches in that year?
                </p>
            </b>
            <p>He figured that if he could answer this question and present a solution that was solely unique to him, he'd have an edge up. So Dave and his team set out on the adventure of research and found some very interesting thingsâ€¦</p>

                After days of research, his team found some datasets from the United States official compilation of datasets, <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/data-breach-notifications-affecting-washington-residents-personal-information-breakdown">data.gov</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                The thing is, there was a problem with the data, but they decided to keep that problem secret. They wanted to make this happen, and they weren't about to let their boss down.
            </p> <p>
                So they did some calculations and prepared the data for presentation:
